<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heat Treated Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heat Stengthened Glass</li><li>Fully Tempered Glass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heat-treated glass market primarily consists of heat-strengthened glass and fully tempered glass. Heat-strengthened glass undergoes controlled heating and cooling processes, offering improved resistance to thermal stress and mechanical loads, making it suitable for applications like facades and internal partitions. Fully tempered glass, on the other hand, is subjected to a more rigorous thermal process, making it significantly stronger and safer, as it shatters into small, blunt pieces upon breakage. Both variants are widely used in construction, automotive, and appliance industries.</p></p>
